# Checkout Finland Service Provider API

2018-09-10

Checkout Identification Service Broker allows Service Providers to implement strong electronic identification (Finnish bank credentials, Mobile ID) easily to websites and mobile apps via single API.

To identify the user the Service Provider (your website) redirects the user to the Identification Service Broker (Checkout) with an authorization request. The user chooses the Identity Provider (a bank or Mobile ID) and is redirected there where he/she authenticates with his/her own credentials. Checkout will process the authentication result, and return the user to your website with verified information about the identity of the user.

## Definitions

- **JWT** or JSON Web Token is a standard for wrapping attributes into a token. JWS is a signed and JWE an encrypted JWT token.
- **OIDC** or OpenID Connect is a standard easy to use protocol for identifying and authenticating users.
- **Service Provider** is the service asking for the user identity.
- **Identity Service Broker** is the Checkout service that lets the user choose an identity provider and that passes the requested user identity information to the service provider.
- **Identity Provider** is a provider of identification, i.e. a Bank or mobile ID.

## Prerequisites

To identify users using the Identity Service Broker and the OIDC API for Service Providers, you need the following pieces of configuration:

* Client identifier

  Your service is identified by a unique client identifier string, which Checkout will generate for you. Basically this is the Merchant ID you get when you place on order to Checkout in https://checkout.fi/verkkokauppiaalle/tilaus/ .

* Client secret

  A shared secret (a password really) to authenticate your service to the Checkout API. Checkout will generate the client secret and provide it to you. In the future you can get from Checkoutâ€™s Extranet.

* Checkout OIDC authorization endpoint

  The Checkout OIDC authorization endpoint for production use is `https://isb.isb.checkout.fi/authorize`. For testing please use the sandbox endpoint `https://isb.sandbox-isb.checkout-developer.fi/authorize`.

* Checkout OIDC token endpoint

  The Checkout OIDC token endpoint for production use is `https://isb.isb.checkout.fi/token`. For testing please use the sandbox endpoint `https://isb.sandbox-isb.checkout-developer.fi/token`.

* Checkout OIDC profile endpoint

  The Checkout OIDC profile endpoint for production use is `https://isb.isb.checkout.fi/profile`. For testing please use the sandbox endpoint `https://isb.sandbox-isb.checkout-developer.fi/profile`. This endpoint provides exactly the same information as the token endpoint and as such is redundant.

* RSA keypair to decrypt identity token

  Checkout will encrypt the identity token identifying the user with your public key and you will have to decrypt it with your private key.

  To generate a 2048 bit RSA key run the command `openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048` (you could replace the filename private.pem with one of your own choosing). Keep this key private. To export the public portion, run the command `openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout`. Register the public key with Checkout, but make sure the key you share begins with `-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`. Checkout will provide an initial keypair for you. In the future you can set them from Checkout's Extranet.

* Checkout's RSA certificate

  Identity tokens are signed by Checkout to protect their content. You must verify the signature against Checkout's certificate. Note that the certificate is rolled over at times. You should support having two valid certificates (old and new) to handle the transition to a new certificate without downtime. Checkout will provide you with the current RSA certificate. In the future you can get them from Checkout's Extranet.


## Security concerns

- Client secret and private RSA key must be protected and not revealed to users.
- Client secret and keys should be rotated every now and then.
- Client secret or keys must not be sent to the user's browser. I.e. processing the identification should be done server side, not in browser side Javascript.

## Flow

Checkout identification service uses the OpenID Connect Authorization Code flow. I.e. the following steps are taken to identify a user:

1. Service Provider directs the user to Checkout's service endpoint with parameters documented below.
2. Checkout lets the user identify themselves using a provider of their choosing.
3. Once identified, the user is passed back to the Service Provider's `redirect_uri` with an access code.
4. The Service Provider makes a direct API call to the Checkout API and gets an encrypted and signed identity token in exchange for the access code.

To initiate the identification process the service provider directs the user to Checkout's OIDC endpoint either by redirect or by direct link. The query string of the request must include the following parameters:

- **client_id** is the client identifier that specifies which service provider is asking for identification.
- **redirect_uri** specifies to which URI on your site (the service provider) you want the user to return to once identification is done. This URI must be registered with Checkout (except when using the sandbox environment) to prevent other services misusing your credentials.
- **response_type** value must be `code`.
- **scope** is a comma separated list of scopes, or  basically sets of information requested. This must include `openid` and `personal_identification_code` . For example `openid profile personal_identity_code`. The `profile` includes `name`, `given_name`, `family_name` and `birthdate`. If the Service Provider's purpose for identifying the user is to create new identification methods, i.e. for example to create an user account with username and password, then the Service Provider must report such purpose by adding either `weak` (for weak identifiers, for example password account) or `strong` (for official strong authentication) to the scopes. Using weak or strong as a purpose may affect pricing so please do check your contract and/or ask Checkout for advice.

The following optional parameters may be used:
- **ui_locales** selects user interface language (`fi`, `sv` or `en`).
- **nonce** value is passed on to identity token as is.
- **prompt** can be set to `consent` to indicate that the user should be asked to consent to personal data being transferred. In this case the Identity Service Broker will display a verification screen after the user has been authenticated.
- **state** is an opaque value you can use to maintain state between request and callback. Use of `state` is recommended.

Example identification requests:

`GET https://isb.sandbox-isb.checkout-developer.fi/oauth/authorize?client_id=example_service_provider&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample-service-provider.example%2Fbell&state=GIlBncQk4vsbThjMNBJ49G&scope=openid%20profile`

`GET https://isb.sandbox-isb.checkout-developer.fi/oauth/authorize?prompt=consent&client_id=example_service_provider&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample-service-provider.example%2Fbell&state=GIlBncQk4vsbThjMNBJ49G&scope=openid%20profile%20strong`

If the authorization request is valid, the user is shown a list of possible means to identify himself/herself. Once the identification process is done or if there is a recoverable error, the user is directed back to the service provider to the URI specified in the request. The following parameters are included in the query string:
- **state** is passed as is from the request.
- **code** is the authorization code for use in the next phase (only included after succesful identification).
- **error** is the reason why identification failed (in case of error only).

Example return:

`GET https://example-service-provider.example/bell?code=eyJhb[...]4bGg&state=GIlBncQk4vsbThjMNBJ49G`

You can fetch the actual user identity token from the token endpoint using the authorization code and a POST request. Pass the authorization code as a named parameter `code` in the request payload.

The request must be authenticated by HTTP Basic Auth with client id and client secret. Use the client id as the username and client secret as the password in the standard `Authorization` header. The header value is the word `Basic` followed by a space and a base64 encoded string of username and password joined by a colon (`:`).

The authorization code can only be used once.

## Identity token

The identity token is a JWT token that contains identity attributes about the user, for example name, date of birth or personal identity code. The token is signed by Checkout's RSA key. The signed token is embedded and encrypted into an JWE token using the service provider's public key.

To obtain the user attributes from the identity token you need to first decrypt the JWE token received from the OIDC token endpoint. Decryption is done using your private RSA key. The decrypted JWS token is signed using Checkout's RSA certificate to prevent tampering. You need to verify that the signature is valid using the JWT library of your choice. The payload of the JWS token embedded in the JWE token contains user information.

The information received depends on the scope of identification request and on what attributes are available. Do note that not all sources of information have given name and family name available as separate attributes. The following attributes may be available currently:

- **birthdate**: Birth date
- **given_name**: Given name
- **family_name**: Family name
- **name**: Family name and given name
- **personal_identity_code**: The Finnish personal identity code

In addition there are these standard attributes:

- **auth_time**: Time of authentication in seconds since UNIX epoch
- **sub**: Subject identifier, not persistent, feel free to ignore

Example:

```json
{
  "sub": "a589adb6-1550-4b17-90c4-a19e8c3f3c0e",
  "name": "von MÃ¶ttonen Matti Matias",
  "given_name": "Matti Matias",
  "family_name": "von MÃ¶ttonen",
  "birthdate": "1900-01-01",
  "auth_time": 1519629890
}
```

## Sandbox

The sandbox differs from the production in three major ways.

- The sandbox environment provides test data instead of real personal information.
- To use the sandbox environment you need to use the separate API endpoints described above.
- Common shared credentials and client id are used for the sandbox environment.

These id's and keys are used for the sandbox environment:

- **Client identifier**: saippuakauppias
- **Client secret**: correct-horse-battery-staple
- **Token decryption key**: See `sandbox-sp-key.pem`
- **Signature verification key**: See `sandbox-isb-public-key.pem`
